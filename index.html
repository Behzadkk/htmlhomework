		<h1>How to choose the best among the rest</h1>
		<p>Although finding people of talent is arduous and there is a war for talent, a company should be obsessed of finding and attracting A-players who can make it distinguished through their short and long-term contribution. A strong EVP, which is designed for the specific type of people, can attract talent to work for a company. This page argues about the journey of recruiting the best among the rest.</p>

		<h2 id="whatIsTalent">What Is Talent</h2>
		<p>Finding talent or A-players, as Mankins, et al., (2013) call them, seems to be a straightforward exercise because of the quantity of educated people and the IT revolution but in the real world it is a complex and frustrating challenge. Besides, having more A-players does not guarantee a company’s success but the company with the right talent wins (Huselid, et al., 2005) and companies should be fanatical about talent (Peters, 2004; Peters, 2010).</p>
		<p>Organisations are seeking to find motivated and talented employees with the potential to perform exceptionally and to add value to the organisation (MacRae & Furnham, 2014). Many researchers have talked about talent but there is wide variation in definition of ‘talent’. The role of talent is more important than its definition; individuals who through their contribution, either short or long term, make a difference to organisational performance (Weeks, 2017).</p>
		<p>Identifying potential is the first step which could be very hard. Because it is not related to success and performance that the person has done in the past, potential is the upper trajectory of what a person realistically can do (MacRae & Furnham, 2014). Therefore, it is a bet and managers wants to spot workers of high potential to increase job success probability.</p>
		<p>Organisations in order to bound ahead of others spend the time and energy to find, develop and retain stars (Fernandez-Araoz, 2014). O'Boyle Jr & Aguini (2012) by conducting a research across a wide range of professions argued that there is a huge difference between the best and the rest. For instance, at Apple the best developer is more than nine times as productive as the average software engineer (Mankins, et al., 2013).</p>

		<h2 id="attractingTalent">Attracting Talent</h2>
		<p>kill shortages are increasing rapidly. The majority of CEOs stated that competition for talent has been intensive over recent years (CIPD, 2015) and for the new generation of talented workforce, “millennials”, money is not everything but also reputation matters (PWC, 2011; PWC, 2016).</p>
		<p>An employee value proposition (EVP) is everything people experience when they are part of an organisation and how their needs, expectation and dreams are fulfilled (Micheals, et al., 2001).Most organisations focusing on improving their employer brand have improved their website, recognising that this is often the first point of contact with potential candidates and a highly effective recruitment channel (CIPD, 2017).</p>
		<p>CERN is one of the companies that developed its EVP by website and social media (CERN, 2012). A strong company EVP will attract more talented people to choose to work for them (Birchall, 2017) albeit a winning EVP must be well designed to appeal to the particular type of talent the company is trying to attract (Micheals, et al., 2001).</p>

		<h2 id="talentRecruitment">Talent Recruitment</h2>
		<p>Recruitment is the process of recognizing capable people and stimulating them to apply for the job in the company. The purposes of recruitment are to share a positive image of the company and attract the interest and commitment of potential good employees (Stewart & Brown, 2011).One of the best example of targeted recruitment is the Hard Rock Café recruitment done by Work4us. To select 120 servers for manager-level positions in 4 weeks, they launched a multi-faceted Facebook campaign. As a result, they not only hired 120 talented employees but also spent only $16 per hire (Work4labs.com, 2011). Thus, an effective recruitment not only can facilitate finding the best players for companies but also it will help to save money.</p>
		<p>Effective recruitment needs more effort because some people of talent are passive. This group of potential job recruits is mostly employed people who are not seeking for a job but are open if a good opportunity arises (Stewart & Brown, 2011). Managers try to stimulate these passive talented individuals to apply. To find passive talent, an organisation can use a program like the MITRE referral system where pays employees a bonus for staff hire (Albright Jr & Cluff, 2005).</p>
		<p>Targeting Gen-Y; For these people, “Digital Natives”, games are a familiar medium which they enjoy and to which they pay attention (Prensky, 2001b). This life style is the reason why in the business field, Gen-Ys are seeking development, training, variety in their daily work and a dynamic approach (Terjesen, et al., 2007). </p>
		<p>Another fact about these “digital natives” is that they have networked most of all their lives (Prensky, 2001a). Facebook is a good place to attract the interest of those of potential to apply to work although other social media must not be neglected because the number of users of other social apps such as Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, and LinkedIn has been increasing while this figure dropped for Facebook-only users.</p>
		<p>If we look at most successful effective recruitments, we will see experiences such as Saatchi & Saatchi (2012), eBay (LinkedIn, 2009), Netflix (Hastings, 2009) and Etsy (Hunt-Morr, 2014) have focused on the millennials’ interests and attracted talents by using social media. Besides, internet recruitment not only helped them to find people of potential but also served to select the best from the pool.

		<h2 id="selectingTalent">Selecting Talent</h2>
		<p>After attracting people of potential to apply for a job in a company, the highest potential person should be selected for hiring who can make the best contribution to the company in the short- and long-term. Selecting the best is a quandary process. Based on Fernandez (2014), the accuracy for best professional interviewers is 70% which potentially will have 79% error. This dilemma exists in all human selection processes.</p>
		<p>Based on Stewart & Brown (2011) a good method should be valid and to be valid it needs to be reliable. A good method should be cost effective and fair and should be acceptable to the applicant. Interview, the most common method of selection is the least reliable (MacRae & Furnham, 2014). Thus, for selection of a talent, interview is not a good method.</p>
		<p>Mangers to confront this problem firstly need to create a greater and more powerful pool of talent as mentioned in the recruitment section. MacRae & Furnham (2014) have argued that identifying and assessing the key indicators of success can be helpful. In this method, mangers need to identify what are the company success indicators, in the other words they are looking for potential to do what, and how great is the importance of each indicator.</p>
		<p>Having determined the correct criteria of potential, the next step is to find out to what extent each candidate possesses each characteristic. In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/selecting-talent-behzad-kakavand/">this article</a> you can find more about various types of assessment</p>
